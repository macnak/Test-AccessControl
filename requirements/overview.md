# Test Access Control

This is a back end TypeScript Web API Server using the latest version of Fastify library. This is to be used with the API Annelaing project to test off the functionality of that project against a concrete Web API system that allows different Access control mechanisms to be used.

With this is the ability to perform multipart forms and file uploads.

Another output of this is an OpenAPI / Swagger covering all the access controls and the Web APIs available. Want to be able to cover all the methods and different body formats from json, to key value pairs to XML. I'm not sure if OpenAPI allows XML or other body formats in the request and response.

Break up each access control method to their own paths. This is to help provide exhaustive coverage of the functionality.

Use dummy files for the credentials of the different access controls. The idea is to allow coverage of happy path, positive and negative calls and boundary coverage.

Would be good to have different data files for some of the responses.

And documenting this.

Could you please perform all the tasks for the initial project setup and have the source located in the source folder. Break up the application, routes and controllers, etc. The idea is to have more coverage as more of the API Annealing project functionality is completed and tested.
